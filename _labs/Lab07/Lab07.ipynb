The scatterplot is deceiving because it automatically scales the variables to make the points fit on the same plot. In reality, the variables are on very different scales. The number of bedrooms and bathrooms range from 0 to 6, while living area is in the thousands. When variables are on such different scales, the variable with the largest variability will dominate the distance metric.\n","\n","The plot below shows the same data, but drawn to scale. You can see that differences in the number of bedrooms and the number of bathrooms hardly matter at all; only the variability in the living area matters.\n","\n","![](https://github.com/nmattei/cmps3160/blob/master/_labs/images/closer_rescaled.png?raw=1)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PxAejGIc8SRT"},"source":["To obtain distances that agree more with our intuition---and that do not give too much weight to any one variable---we transform the variables to be on the same scale.

All three methods scale the variables in similar (but slightly different) ways, resulting in figure-eights with different aspect ratios.  Standardizing also moves the data to be centered around the origin, while min-max scaling moves the data to be in a box whose corners are $(0, 0)$ and $(1,

(In fact, the `survived` column in the Titanic data set is an example of a variable where this has been done.) But what do we do about a categorical variable with more than 2 categories, like `embarked`, which has 3 categories?\n","\n","We can convert a categorical variable with $K$ categories into $K$ separate 0/1 variables, or **dummy variables**. Each of the $K$ variables is an indicator for one of the $K$ categories. That is, each dummy variable is 1 if the observation fell into that category and 0 otherwise.\n","\n","Although it is not difficult to create dummy variables manually, the easiest way to create them is the `get_dummies()` function in `pandas`. \n","\n","Note, in newer versions of Pandas, we must specify the paramter `dtype=\"int'` to return quantitative (0/1) values rather than boolean
