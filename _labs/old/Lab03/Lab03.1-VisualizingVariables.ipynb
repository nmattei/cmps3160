    "By default, Python outputs graphics to a new window. But what if we want a record of the graphic? We could save the graphic to an image file, but then the graphic and the code that generated it would live in different files. If these files were to ever get separated, then it may be difficult to regenerate the graphic. In other words, the standard Python workflow is not **reproducible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks support a reproducible workflow, by allowing graphics to be embedded directly in a notebook. Now, the graphic and the code that generated it live in the same file, adjacent to one another. To make graphics show up in the Jupyter notebook, we have to specify that `matplotlib` (the main graphics library in Python) should output the graphic to the \"inline\" backend, as opposed to, for example, a backend that makes the graphic appear in a new window. To specify a backend for `matplotlib`, we run a so-called **magic command** (or just **magic**, for short). Magic commands modify the behavior of a notebook or an individual cell. For example, the `%timeit` magic, which we will use later in this book, times how long it takes to run a line of code. You can recognize magics because they are preceded by `%` or `%%`. For a full list of magics, consult [the documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html).\n",
