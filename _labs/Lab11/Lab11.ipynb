However, for our purposes we just need to understand a few basics:\n","1. When you hit `enter` on your web-browser, the browser issues a `GET` command to the webserver, asking for the default homepage, typically a page called `index.html`.\n","2. The server then sends back either the contents of that page with a HTTP code `200`, meaning everything worked, or it sends back an error like `404`, meaning that you asked for a page it doesn't know how to find. You can read more about [HTTP Error codes here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).\n","3. Your browser then takes that page, perhaps issuing even more requests to other pages to grab content like rich media, and then puts all this together into an interactive display that you can use on your desktop.\n","\n","So, at a high level, our computer asks for something, and the web server sends it back to us!\n","\n","Throughout this demo we are going to work with the webpage for the [Data Science course at the University of Maryland by Prof. John P. Dickerson](http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2018/cmsc320/). The course here at Tulane owes a big debt to John who helped us come up with much of the content for this course.\n","\n","To start out with, let's try to get the contents of the course, not in our web-browser but instead just to see the text!

It has drawn tremendous attention from both academia and industry and is making deep inroads in industry, government, health and journalism&mdash;just ask <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fivethirtyeight-gave-trump-a-better-chance-than-almost-anyone-else/\">Nate Silver</a>!</p>\n","\t\n","\t<p>This course focuses on (i) data management systems, (i) exploratory and statistical data analysis, (ii) data and information visualization, and (iv) the presentation and communication of analysis results. It will be centered around case studies drawing extensively from applications, and will yield a publicly-available final project that will strengthen course participants' data science portfolios.</p>\n","\n","\t<p>This course will consist primarily of sets of self-contained lectures and assignments that leverage real-world data science platforms when needed; as such, there is no assigned textbook.  Each lecture will come with links to required reading, which should be done before that lecture, and (when appropriate) a list of links to other resources on the web.</p>\n","\t\n","\t<h3>Requirements</h3>\n","\t<p>\n","\t  Students enrolled in the course should be comfortable with programming (for those at UMD, having passed CMSC216 will be good enough!) and be reasonably mathematically mature.  The course itself will make heavy use of the <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\">Python</a> scripting language by way of <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter</a> Notebooks, leaning on the <a href=\"http://conda.pydata.org/docs/\">Anaconda</a> package manager; we'll give some Python-for-data-science primer lectures early on, so don't worry if you haven't used Python before.  Later lectures will delve into statistics and machine learning and may make use of basic calculus and basic linear algebra; light mathematical maturity is preferred at roughly the level of a junior CS student.\n","\t</p>\n","\n","\t<p>\n","\t  There will be one written, in-class midterm examination.  There will <em>not</em> be a final examination; rather, in the interest of building students' public portfolios, and in the spirit of &quot;learning by doing&quot;, students will create a self-contained <strong>online tutorial to be posted publicly</strong>.  This tutorial can be created individually or in a small group.  As described <a href=\"files/cmsc320_f2018_final_rubric.pdf\">here</a> (<em>subject to change!</em>), the tutorial will be a publicly-accessible website that provides an end-to-end walkthrough of identifying and scraping a specific data source, performing some exploratory analysis, and providing some sort of managerial or operational insight from that data.  \n","\t</p>\n","\n","\t<p>\n","\t  Final grades will be calculated as:\n","\t  <ul>\n","\t    <li>10% weekly quizzes</li>\n","\t    <li>25% midterm</li>\n","\t    <li>40% mini-project assignments</li>\n","\t    <li>25% final tutorial to be posted publicly online (<a href=\"files/cmsc320_f2018_final_rubric.pdf\">instructions</a>, <em>subject to change!</em>)</li>\n","\t    <li>5% course, Piazza, and office hours participation (extra credit!)</li>\n","\t  </ul>\n","\t</p>\n","\n","\t<p>\n","\t  You can earn full credit for class participation in three ways:\n","\t  <ol>\n","\t    <li>Lecture participation, asking questions and answering your peers questions;</li>\n","\t    <li>Piazza participation, asking and answering questions on Piazza; and</li>\n","\t    <li>Regular attendance at office hours.</li>\n","\t  </ol>\n","\t  To earn full credit you should aim to ask or answer a question at least once every two weeks in lecture or on Piazza; or attend office hours at least once a month (this can include just going to my office hours to chat about computer science, data, science, software engineering, etc.).\n","\t</p>\n","\n","\t<p><em>This course is aimed at junior- and senior-level Computer Science majors, but should be accessible to any student of life with some degree of mathematical and statistical maturity, reasonable experience with programming, and an interest in the topic area.

There are quite a few gotchas with working with HTML so for any page you want to read you'll have to make sure the table is well formatted, and that the Pandas function is working.\n","\n","Note that there are more than a few **Gotcha's** in the below example.\n","1. `find` lazily evaluates the search, so we have to use the `str` command to force Beautiful Soup to return a string that can be passed into `read_html` like it expects.\n","2. If we look at the documentation for `read_html` we find that it returns a **list of tables** since there might be more than one, so here we need to simply display the first table."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"id":"c7fef3a9","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":331},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1034,"status":"ok","timestamp":1691168456122,"user":{"displayName":"Aron C","userId":"07834910496055545653"},"user_tz":300},"id":"c7fef3a9","outputId":"05bc9a80-660d-44f7-cfce-11231f829795"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["\n","\n","  <div id=\"df-f55ed91d-0da2-47a1-abd9-4a38b6510c73\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Human</th>\n","      <th>Time</th>\n","      <th>Location</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Eleftheria Briakou</td>\n","      <td>Mondays, 11:45am–1:45pm</td>\n","      <td>AVW 1120</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Hao Chen</td>\n","      <td>Fridays, 3pm–5pm</td>\n","      <td>AVW 1120</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>John Dickerson</td>\n","      <td>TBD 1hr/wk.
