It is important to think about what each row represents, or the **unit of observation**, before starting a data analysis. In the Titanic `DataFrame`, the unit of observation is a passenger.

The right representation depends on the question you are trying to answer: if you are studying families on the Titanic, then you might want the unit of observation to be a family, but if you need to know which passengers survived, then you might prefer that it be a passenger. No matter which representation you choose, it is important to be conscious of the unit of observation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tEMm6PMYeABj"},"source":["### The Row Index\n","\n","In a `DataFrame`, each observation is identified by an index. You can determine the index of a `DataFrame` by looking for the **bolded** values at the beginning of each row when you print the `DataFrame`. For example, notice how the numbers **0**, **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, ... above are bolded, which means that this `DataFrame` is indexed by integers starting from 0. This is the default index when you read in a data set from disk into `pandas`, unless you explicitly specify otherwise."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4z-BIZgQeABj"},"source":["Since each row represents one passenger, it might be useful to re-index the rows by the name of the passenger. To do this, we call the `.set_index()` method of `DataFrame`, passing in the name of the column we want to use as the index.

Just because a variable happens to contain numbers does not necessarily make it \"quantitative\". For example, consider the variable `survived` in the Titanic data set. Each passenger either survived or didn't. This data set happens to use 1 for \"survived\" and 0 for \"died\", but these numbers do not reflect an underlying numeric scale.\n","\n","Variables that are not quantitative but take on a limited set of values are called **nominal or categorical variables**. For example, the variable `sex` takes on one of two possible values (\"female\" or \"male\"), so it is a categorical variable. So is the variable `home.dest`, which takes on a larger, but still limited, set of values. We call each possible value of a categorical variable a \"category\". Although categories are usually non-numeric (as in the case of `sex` and `home.dest`), they are sometimes numeric. For example, the variable `survived` in the Titanic data set is a categorical variable with two categories (1 if the passenger survived, 0 if they didn't), even though those values are numbers. With a categorical variable, one common analysis question is, \"How many observations are there in each category?\".\n","\n","Some variables do not fit neatly into either category. For example, the variable `name` in the Titanic data set is obviously not quantitative, but it is not categorical either because it does not take on a limited set of values. Generally speaking, every passenger will have a different name (the two James Kellys notwithstanding), so it does not make sense to analyze the frequencies of different names, as one might do with a categorical variable. We will group variables like `name`, that are neither quantitative nor categorical, into an \"other\" category.\n","\n","Every variable can be classified into one of these three **types**: quantitative, categorical, or other. The type of the variable often dictates the kind of analysis we do and the kind of visualizations we make, as we will see later in this chapter.\n","\n","`pandas` tries to infer the type of each variable automatically. If every value in a column (except for missing values) can be cast to a number, then `pandas` will treat that variable as quantitative. Otherwise, the variable is treated as categorical. To see the type that Pandas inferred for a variable, simply select that variable using the methods above and look for its `dtype`. A `dtype` of `float64` or `int64` indicates that the variable is quantitative.  For example, the `age` variable above had a `dtype` of `float64`, so it is quantitative.
