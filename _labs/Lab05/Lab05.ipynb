First, there is no longer any way to distinguish the 1995 data from the 2015 data. To fix this, we can add a \"Year\" column to each `DataFrame` before we concatenate. Second, the indexes from the individual `DataFrame`s have been preserved. (To see this, observe that the last index in the `DataFrame` is 32,951, which corresponds to the number of rows in `names2015`, but there are actually 59,032 rows in the `DataFrame`.) That means that there are two rows with an index of 0, two rows with an index of 1, and so on.

`ignore_index=True`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1691170083539,"user":{"displayName":"Aron
