Therein lies the problem with training error. Training error measures how well a model predicts on the current data. It is possible to build a model that **overfits** to the training data---that is, a model that fits so well to the current data that it does poorly on future data.\n","\n","For example, consider fitting two different models to the 10 training observations shown below. The model represented by the red line actually passes through every observation (that is, its training error is zero). However, most people would prefer the model represented by the blue line. If one had to make a prediction for $y$ when $x = 0.8$, the value of the blue line is intuitively more plausible than the value of the red line, which is out of step with the nearby points.\n","\n","![](https://github.com/nmattei/cmps3160/blob/master/_labs/images/overfitting.png?raw=1)\n","\n","The argument for the blue model depends on _future_ data because the blue model is actually worse than the red model on the current data. The red model tries so hard to get the predictions on the training data right that it ends up _overfitting_.\n","\n","If the goal is to build a model that performs well on future data, then we ought to evaluate it (i.e., by calculating MSE, MAE, etc.) on future data. The prediction error on future data is also known as **test error**, in contrast to training error, which is the prediction error on current data. To calculate the test error, we need _labeled_ future data. In many applications, future data is expensive to collect and _labeled_ future data is even more expensive. How can we approximate the test error, using just the data that we have?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BdndmRCs6Kvf"},"source":["### Validation Error\n","\n","The solution is to split the training data into a **training set** and a **validation set**. The model will only be fit on the observations of the training set. Then, the model will be evaluated on the validation set. Because the validation set has not been seen by the model already, it essentially plays the role of \"future\" data, even though it was carved out of the current data.\n","\n","The prediction error on the validation set is known as the **validation error**. The validation error is an approximation to the test error."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ejUFUjsN6Kvf"},"source":["To split our data into training and validation sets, we use the `.sample()` function in `pandas`.

In general, we can split the data into $k$ subsamples, alternately training the data on $k-1$ subsamples and evaluating the model on the $1$ remaining subsample, i.e., the validation set. This produces $k$ somewhat independent estimates of the test error. This procedure is known as **$k$-fold cross validation**. (Be careful not to confuse the $k$ in $k$-fold cross validation with the $k$ in $k$-nearest neighbors.) Therefore, the specific version of cross validation that we saw earlier is $2$-fold cross validation.\n","\n","A schematic of $4$-fold cross validation is shown below.\n","\n","![](https://github.com/nmattei/cmps3160/blob/master/_labs/images/k-folds.png?raw=1)\n","\n","Implementing $k$-fold cross validation from scratch for $k > 2$ is straightforward but messy, so we will usually let Scikit-Learn do it for us."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hzb6geG66Kvj"},"source":["### Cross Validation in Scikit-Learn\n","\n","Scikit-Learn provides a function, `cross_val_score`, that will carry out all aspects of $k$-fold cross validation:\n","\n","1. split the data into $k$ subsamples\n","2. combine the first $k-1$ subsamples into a training set and train the model\n","3. evaluate the model predictions on the last ($k$th) held-out subsample\n","4. repeat steps 2-3 $k$ times (i.e. $k$ \"folds\"), each time holding out a different one of the $k$ subsamples\n","4. calculate $k$ \"scores\", one from each validation set\n","\n","There is one subtlety to keep in mind. Training a $k$-nearest neighbors model is not just about fitting the model; it also involves dummifying the categorical variables and scaling the variables.

To do so would be allowing the model to peek at the validation set during training.

To be completely above board, we should standardize each training set with respect to the mean and SD of just that training set.\n","\n","Fortunately, Scikit-Learn provides a `Pipeline` object that allows us to chain these preprocessing steps together with the model we want to fit."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":179,"status":"ok","timestamp":1691168808225,"user":{"displayName":"Aron C","userId":"07834910496055545653"},"user_tz":300},"id":"wLJyuXp-6Kvj"},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.feature_extraction import DictVectorizer\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","\n","# get the features (in dict format) and the labels\n","# (do not split into training and validation sets)\n","features = [\"Lot Area\", \"Gr Liv Area\",\n","            \"Full Bath\", \"Half Bath\",\n","            \"Bedroom AbvGr\",\n","            \"Year Built\", \"Yr Sold\",\n","            \"Neighborhood\"]\n","X_dict = housing[features].to_dict(orient=\"records\")\n","y = housing[\"SalePrice\"]\n","\n","# specify the pipeline\n","vec = DictVectorizer(sparse=False)\n","scaler = StandardScaler()\n","model = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=10)\n","pipeline = Pipeline([(\"vectorizer\", vec), (\"scaler\", scaler), (\"fit\", model)])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2diIGKws6Kvj"},"source":["This entire `Pipeline` can be passed to `cross_val_score`, along with the data, the number of folds $k$ (`cv`), and the type of score (`scoring`).
